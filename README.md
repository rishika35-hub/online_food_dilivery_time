## 📂 Dataset Files

- **Excel File:**  
  👉 [`Rajnish6605510/Food_Delivery_Analysis.xlsx`](https://github.com/rishika35-hub/online_food_dilivery_time/blob/main/Rajnish6605510/Food_Delivery_Analysis.xlsx)

- **CSV File:**  
  👉 [`Rajnish6605510/food_delivery_time_estimation.csv`](https://github.com/rishika35-hub/online_food_dilivery_time/blob/main/Rajnish6605510/food_delivery_time_estimation.csv)

These files include delivery times, expected delivery times, distances, delay labels, and weather information.

## 📓 Analysis Notebook

👉 [`Rajnish6605510/only_food_dilvery_time.ipynb`](https://github.com/rishika35-hub/online_food_dilivery_time/blob/main/Rajnish6605510/only_food_dilvery_time.ipynb)

This Jupyter Notebook contains:

- Data cleaning & preprocessing  
- Delay identification logic  
- Relationship analysis (distance vs delivery time)  
- Weather impact evaluation  
- Chart plotting code  

It’s the **core analysis file** for this project.
